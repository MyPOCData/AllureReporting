What are the different test data sources (Excel, XML, DB, etc)?

= Application data is retrieved from data fabric (PAC, GRS) however the calcu-
lations are performed in middle tier

= Models are developed in excel by BAs and then exported to XML and then
put in tests for comparison

High Level Requirements:

= The system should be able to calculate the Portfolio Risk exposure.

= Transformation layer to be implemented over the main data residing
in Main data fabric and accordingly the data should be populated in
AAPE database

= The Risk exposure range should be validated by the ranges defined
in the downstream compliance system

= The server on which the AAPE resides will have its own security to
prevent unauthorized write/delete access. There is no restriction on
read access.

Test Suite Objectives:
e Test Suite to verify correctness of calculations

e To verify the behaviour of system is as expected

Some information is provided about current state of testing for other application ar-
eas:

Type of the Applications? Web applications
Who are the users who use the Test Suite? (BA, Dev, and QA)

What is the testing procedure? Based on bandwidth of Dev/ QA/BA, anyone pitches
to do testing

How many releases are planned for each application? One release every 4 weeks
How many test execution cycles are planned per release? Random, need based
What is the effort required to run one test cycle manually? Difficult to estimate
How often and how many bugs were reported in the recent test cycles?

= There aren’t any big issues open. Two issues were found because of an er-
roneous requirement and fixed in last iteration deployed.

* Total of 12 bugs opened so far, 1 P1 that is basically a control issue
